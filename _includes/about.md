# Artist Statement

My art is a visual metaphor of our Infinite Interconnectedness; a glimpse of a timeless space where the veils of separation are lifted, simultaneously exposing all levels of reality as ONE network of BEING. Mandalas are graphic symbols representing the universe in it's entirety; the interlacing of the macro- and microcosm; a reflection of each viewer, and a reflection of us all together. I am a translator of the language of spirits into color; transmuter of energy into form; transformer of material objects into spiritual reflections. To my highest ability, I paint as a tool serving the Divine, delivering visually comprehendible messages to our Earthly realm, and inspiring individuals to recognize the Divine within themselves.

# More Behind the Brushstrokes...

It has become my mission as a painter to positively influence the mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies of a viewer through my paintings. The mandala (described in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as a "graphic symbol of the universe,") has been an encompassing theme in my paintings, pictorially displaying the unification of multiplicities. Within the mandala, I combine specific colors, sacred geometry, and influences from my surroundings to accomplish the goal of evoking a positive change (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual) in the viewer.

As a studio and live painter, my paintings are constantly being influenced by people, visions, meditations, experiences, and various other studies and environmental influences that I interact with throughout the making of a painting. Often, these energies and influences are the things that drive my paintbrush along the surface of the canvas in a subconscious flow. Through the combination of my subconscious, outside influences, visions, references, and a little mental work, my paintings come to fruition.

Colors play an important role in our lives, and also in my paintings.  I commonly choose a color based on how the color's vibrational frequency interacts with the human body and psyche, while also taking into consideration their reactions with other colors in the painting. My paintings are also commenced without any intention besides to open as a channel and allow creativity to flow, and my hand to be guided by Higher energies and influences.

Sacred Geometry is also a significant aspect in my paintings, as they are shapes that resonate with all living creatures, aid in healing, aid in contemplative meditation, and visually display Our Unity. Sacred Geometric forms are the foundational structures of biology and consciousness, connecting us directly to every aspect of our environment physically and spiritually.

Through the use of these geometric forms, translations of energies, and colors chosen with their vibrational frequencies in mind, I hope reach a viewer on multiple levels; physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The imagery and sacred geometry are meant to convey symbolically the connection between all things, and the possibility of breaking through the illusion of separation. Every painting involves cultivation of compassion for both myself and the viewer of the art. I work with love and light to my highest ability. With these tools, I hope that the paintings begin to have a life or essence of their own that gives them the ability to spread positive emotion, healing vibrations, and ignite the flame of compassion through the realization that all is ONE.

Infinite Love & Blessings,

Morgan Mandala Manley
